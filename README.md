Let me introduce myself. My name is Gustavo Prado and my close relationship with computers began as a child, when I spent countless hours tinkering and adjusting things on my computer together with my cousin. My first contact with code was around the age of 10, when I entered the world of MTA mods and plugins to create servers and develop modpacks. Now I'm 20 years old and I'm a junior developer at Sicredi Norte Sul, I'm following my dream of being an increasingly better software developer, always seeking to improve my knowledge!
